## Inspiration
There was no inspiration, just two bored college students trying to do something during finals week (anything other than studying) 

## What it does
This is a rock, paper, scissor game recreated in Java. It asks the user to choose between rock, paper, or scissors, and the program will tell the user if they won/lose the game. The game's rules are the same as the traditional rock, paper, scissors game. 

## How we built it
We collaborated and build the code in Replit, and the language used was Java. It uses Java tools: scanners and random. It consists of multiple methods that were used to organize the project. _This code was made in two hours_

## Challenges we ran into
There were multiple challenges that we ran into:
1. In the **userChoice** method, we ran into redundancy in checking if an integer is inputted instead of a string
2. In the **startGame** method, we ran into a problem where we did not know how to call the other method to keep the game running. 
3. We ran into a problem when using random numbers as Java would not give us 0 as a random number, we had to increase the size of the array. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
One of the team members just learned Java and this is his second game coded in Java, yet we were able to make this game in two hours. 

## What we learned
We learned that it is really easy to create a game when you're bored. This project also serves as a little refresher after only coding for class, and not for fun. We were also able to properly collaborate and work together on Replit at the same time, instead of just distributing it by methods. 

## What's next for RoShamBo
A feature we could add to RoShamBo is that we could keep it running using a while loop.
